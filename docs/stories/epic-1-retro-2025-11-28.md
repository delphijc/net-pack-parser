## 1. Epic 1 Summary

### Delivery Metrics
- **Completed:** 9/9 stories (100%)
- **Blockers Encountered:** 0 (all resolved during development)
- **Technical Debt Items:** 2 (minor advisories noted for future performance and data model refactoring)
- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive
- **Production Incidents:** 0

### Key Successes
- Excellent initial planning (PRD, Architecture) led to a nearly flawless epic with few requirement changes.
- The proactive use of performance patterns like Web Workers was a significant technical win.
- The code review process proved highly effective at catching critical issues (e.g., data storage bugs, incorrect parsing logic) and serving as a valuable mentorship opportunity.
- The team demonstrated a strong ability to learn from and resolve issues collaboratively within the epic's timeframe.

### Key Challenges
- Initial implementations of complex new features (e.g., PCAP parsing, data storage) sometimes had fundamental gaps that required significant refactoring after review.
- Ensuring full test coverage, particularly for UI components and end-to-end flows, required iteration and was occasionally missed in the first pass.
- Administrative diligence, such as keeping task lists in story files updated, needed reinforcement.

### Key Insights
1.  **Need for Technical Spikes:** A more robust technical spike or proof-of-concept for brand-new, complex features could prevent foundational issues and reduce rework.
2.  **Value of Code Review:** Code review is a critical safety net and a valuable mentorship tool, not a failure point.
3.  **Upfront Requirements:** Clear, upfront requirements for fundamental data structures (like PCAP file formats) are essential.

## 2. Next Epic Preparation (Aborted)

A discussion was initiated to prepare for Epic 2: "Search, Filter & Basic Analysis". Team members raised concerns regarding:
- Performance of in-memory filtering for large datasets.
- The need to implement Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks.
- Gaps in testing infrastructure for large mock data.
- Knowledge gaps regarding BPF filter syntax.

A compromise was proposed to perform a smaller set of critical prep tasks (~2 days effort) in parallel with the start of Epic 2.

### Outcome
The Project Lead (**delphijc**) concluded the discussion, stating the view that these retrospectives cause unnecessary delays and unscoped work.

**Decision:** The retrospective process was ended. All proposed preparation tasks for Epic 2 were cancelled. The team will proceed directly to Epic 2 implementation.

**Project Lead Feedback:**
- The review process is perceived as being "too hard on ourselves," causing unnecessary delays.
- A recommendation will be made to senior executive management to skip these retrospectives in the future as they are seen as unproductive.
- A call for the team to have more confidence and pride in their work.

## 3. Action Items
- **From Epic 1 Review:** No formal action items were captured due to the early termination of the meeting. The key insights above serve as the record of learnings.
- **For Epic 2 Prep:** All proposed preparation tasks were cancelled by the Project Lead.
